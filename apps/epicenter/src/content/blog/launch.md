## Launching Epicenter — Your Personal AI OS, Starting with Whispering and OpenCode

Hey everyone,

We’re building **Epicenter**, a personal AI operating system where *you own your data, choose your models,* and can gradually replace every siloed app in your life with open, interoperable alternatives.

Our mission is simple: **put you at the center of your digital ecosystem** — not some API key, vendor, or closed model. Whether it’s transcription, code, writing, or planning your life, Epicenter keeps your context portable and model-agnostic. You can take it anywhere, use it with any model, and remix it however you want.

We’re starting with two apps:

### 🗣 Whispering — Transcription, Done Right

Whispering is a minimal, privacy-first transcription app built on top of OpenAI’s Whisper. Local or cloud transcription, your choice. Fast, accurate, no lock-in. Export to markdown, share snippets, and own the text.

Whispering is a fast, privacy-respecting transcription app that supports multiple models — including Whisper and other local or cloud-based backends.
You can transcribe audio, export to markdown, and fully own the text. There’s no lock-in, and no hidden pipelines. It’s just clean, usable transcription — how it should be.

### 💻 Epicenter.sh — Talk to Code on Your Own Terms

Epicenter.sh lets you spin up a local [OpenCode](https://github.com/epicenterlabs/opencode) instance and talk to it using natural language. We tunnel your self-hosted environment via Cloudflare Tunnels, so you can chat with your codebase securely from anywhere. No vendor lock-in. It’s your code, your compute.

Prefer your own tunneling provider? No problem — you can self-host the URL and endpoint as well.

But those are just the starting points.

What we’re really building is an **ecosystem of open-source, AI-native tools** — text editors, to-do apps, email clients, creative assistants — all with a shared foundation:

* **Your data lives on your device**
* **You can use any AI model (local or cloud)**
* **Apps are modular and talk to each other**
* Context is portable and consistent across tools
* **Context is composable and persistent**

We believe in a future where **personal context is a superpower** — not a product someone sells back to you. In the age of AGI, *sharing consistent context across tools* is incredibly powerful. Rather than splitting your attention between apps, you unify it. Imagine curating a lifetime of ideas, notes, code, and memories — and asking *any* model to help you make sense of it all.

We think the next generation of tools aren’t apps — they’re **interfaces into your own knowledge**, and that interface should be open, ownable, and extendable.

We're just getting started. If you want to build a world where people don’t need to trade their autonomy for convenience, we’d love your thoughts and feedback.
